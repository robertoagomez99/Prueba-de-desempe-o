## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this site is to present a functional and visual mockup of a personal project, with:

- Clear semantic structure.
- Modern and responsive design.
- Visual interaction through animations.
- Organization of informative and visual content.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- Semantic tags: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`.
- Accessibility and logical structure.

- **CSS**
- Responsive design with `Flexbox`, `Grid`, and `Media Queries`.
- `Transitions` and `Animations` for visual effects.
- `Background: linear-gradient` to enhance the visual design.

## 📐 File Structure

├── styles.css # Styles organized by sections and responsive
└── README.md # Technical documentation for the project

## 🖥️ Content and Structure

### 1. `header`
- Contains the logo and the main navigation menu.
- The logo is a representative circular image.

### 2. `main`
- Divided into several semantic sections:

#### 🔹 `#home` section
- Implementation of a responsive grid with a hover effect.

#### 🔹 `#projects` section
- Images with descriptive text and hover animation.

#### 🔹 `#bio` section
- A short biography.
#### 🔹 `aside`
- Contact form.
- Visual separation with a different background and a card style.

### 3. `footer`
- Copyright information and site closure.

## 🎨 Responsive Design

- **@media queries applied for different screen widths:
- Adjustments to the main page layout (from columns to a single column).
- Navigation menu adapted to mobile devices.
- Gallery and cards adjusted to fit small screens.

- **auto-fit and `minmax()` used to make images behave smoothly and responsively.
## ✨ Visual Effects

- **CSS Animations:**
- `fadeIn`: applied to `header` and `footer` to smooth the fade-in.
- `scaleIn`: fade-in animation for the logo.

- **Transitions:**
- Applied to links, buttons, and images to achieve a smooth effect.
- Hover over images to highlight

## 📱 Responsive View

You can test the design on different devices using your browser's inspection tools or by resizing the window. All content adjusts correctly without losing functionality or design.
